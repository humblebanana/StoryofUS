A Tour Guide at the Presidential Palace
At the Presidential Palace scenic area in Nanjing, there is a tour guide whom colleagues and visitors usually call "Uncle." His job is to lead tourists on tours and explain the history of the site.
He is somewhat different from other guides because his understanding of history is very deep. He is not only familiar with the architecture and exhibits of the Presidential Palace but also has a thorough grasp of Nanjing's history as the political center for multiple dynasties and regimes.
During his tours, he can share many historical details that are not found in textbooks. When mentioning historical figures like Chiang Kai-shek, his assessments are objective, explaining both their achievements and their limitations. He also has his own profound insights into the changes of history, which he shares with visitors.
He often uses breaks in his narration to encourage the young people in his tour group to read more books and learn more about history. He believes that history is the culmination of our ancestors' wisdom, and understanding the past is essential to better understanding the present and the future. His style of presentation is passionate and can capture tourists' attention, sparking an interest in what might otherwise seem like dry history.
Through his storytelling, the buildings and artifacts of the Presidential Palace are no longer static. He lets visitors know the stories that might have happened behind every brick and every wall, making the entire tour more vivid and meaningful.
Many visitors have commented that after listening to his tour, they truly felt the historical weight of the Presidential Palace. His presence allows historical knowledge to be transmitted to the public in a more accessible way, turning a simple "check-in" visit into a profound cultural experience.
