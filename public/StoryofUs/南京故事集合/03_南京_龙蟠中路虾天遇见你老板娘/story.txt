# 龙蟠中路虾天遇见你老板娘 ｜ The Shrimp Empress on Longpan Middle Road

在南京龙蟠中路，车流和噪音是这里永恒的背景。路边有一家小龙虾店，店面不大，但一到饭点，门口总会热闹起来。
店主是一位来自苏北的女士。她以前在老家盱眙就是做小龙虾的厨师。后来因为儿子在南京工作，她便也来到了南京，开起了这家店。这样既能照顾儿子，也算有了一份自己的事业。
她把家乡的味道带了过来。店里最出名的就是十三香小龙虾。她说，做好小龙虾，没什么秘诀，就是食材要好，工序要对。
为了保证食材的新鲜，她对小龙虾的挑选很严格。每天送来的虾，她都要亲自过目，只有那些鲜活、干净的才能留下。从清洗、处理到下锅烹饪，每一个环节她都亲自动手，因为她相信，只有这样才能保证最后端上桌的味道是最好的。
她的十三香配方是自己多年摸索出来的，香料的搭配有自己的讲究。烧制时，火候的控制也很关键。正因为这份用心，她店里的小龙虾味道很受食客欢迎，很多人吃过一次就成了回头客。
除了是老板，她更像一个厨师。她把小龙虾这道菜看得很重，既要保留传统盱眙的风味，也根据南京人的口味做了一些微调，让更多人能喜欢。
现在，她这家小店在南京的美食圈里已经小有名气。很多人会特地开车过来，就为了吃一盘她烧的小龙-虾。
对她来说，开这家店，不仅是为了赚钱养家，也是把自己最熟悉、最自豪的手艺分享出去。当看到客人们吃得满意时，她觉得这就是对她最大的肯定。通过一盘盘小龙虾，她把对家乡的感情和对生活的热情，都传递给了这座城市的食客。

The Crayfish Shop on Longpan Middle Road
On Longpan Middle Road in Nanjing, the flow of traffic and noise form a constant backdrop. Along this road, there is a crayfish shop. The storefront is not large, but it always gets lively around mealtimes.
The owner is a lady from northern Jiangsu. She used to be a crayfish chef back in her hometown, Xuyi. Later, because her son was working in Nanjing, she also came to the city and opened this shop. This way, she could take care of her son and have a business of her own.
She brought the flavors of her hometown with her. The most famous dish in the shop is the Thirteen Spice Crayfish. She says there's no secret to making good crayfish—it's just about using good ingredients and following the right process.
To ensure the freshness of her ingredients, she is very strict about selecting the crayfish. She personally inspects the shrimp delivered each day, keeping only the ones that are fresh, lively, and clean. From washing and preparing to cooking, she handles every step herself because she believes it's the only way to guarantee the best flavor for the final dish served to customers.
Her thirteen-spice recipe was developed through her own years of experience, and the combination of spices follows her specific method. Controlling the heat during cooking is also crucial. Because of this dedication, the crayfish at her shop is very popular with diners, and many become repeat customers after trying it just once.
Besides being the owner, she is more like a chef. She takes the dish of crayfish very seriously. She aims to preserve the traditional Xuyi flavor while also making slight adjustments to suit the tastes of Nanjing locals, allowing more people to enjoy it.
Now, her small shop has become quite well-known in Nanjing's food scene. Many people will drive over from far away just to have a plate of her crayfish.
For her, running this shop is not just about earning a living. It's also about sharing the craft she knows best and is most proud of. When she sees her customers eating with satisfaction, she feels it is the greatest affirmation of her work. Through each plate of crayfish, she conveys her affection for her hometown and her passion for life to the diners of this city.
