# 龙蟠中路虾天遇见你老板娘 ｜ The Shrimp Empress on Longpan Middle Road

南京的龙蟠中路，总是在车流与噪音的包裹之中，节奏飞快。然而，就在这片喧嚣的路边，有一家小龙虾店，用它独特的香气，固执地为这条路增添了一抹属于“慢食”的烟火气。
店面不大，一到饭点，门口便会热闹起来。店主是位来自苏北盱眙的女士，光是“盱眙”这两个字，就足以成为这家店品质的无声背书。她曾是老家的一名小龙虾厨师，后来因为儿子在南京工作，便也跟了过来，开了这家店。这既是她对儿子的照应，也是她将自己的手艺，在另一座城市里重新扎根。
她把家乡最引以为傲的味道，原封不动地搬了过来。店里的招牌，自然是十三香小龙虾。问起秘诀，她的话很朴实：“没什么特别的，就是东西要好，一步都不能错。”
这份“不能错”，体现在每一个环节里。每天送来的小龙虾，她必须亲自过目、挑选，只有那些生猛鲜活、虾腹干净的，才能入她的厨房。从剪头、去虾线，到下锅前的最后一次冲洗，她都亲力亲为。她不放心把这些关键步骤交给别人，因为她相信，味道的成败，就藏在这些不厌其烦的细节里。
她的十三香配方，是自己多年摸索出的心血，多一种香料则腻，少一种则寡。下锅烧制时，她对火候的把控更是精准。正是这份近乎苛刻的用心，让她的小龙虾味道正宗，香气醇厚，许多食客尝过一次，便成了这里的常客。
在这里，她首先是一个厨师，其次才是一个老板。她把小龙虾这道菜看得很重，既要守住盱眙的传统风味，也悄悄根据南京人的口味做了些许微调。她希望这道菜，能被更多的人真心喜欢。
如今，这家开在主干道旁的小店，已在南京的美食圈里有了名气。常有人特地开车穿过半个城市，就为了这一盘她亲手烧制的小龙虾。

The Crayfish Shop on Longpan Middle Road
On Longpan Middle Road in Nanjing, the flow of traffic and noise form a constant backdrop. Along this road, there is a crayfish shop. The storefront is not large, but it always gets lively around mealtimes.
The owner is a lady from northern Jiangsu. She used to be a crayfish chef back in her hometown, Xuyi. Later, because her son was working in Nanjing, she also came to the city and opened this shop. This way, she could take care of her son and have a business of her own.
She brought the flavors of her hometown with her. The most famous dish in the shop is the Thirteen Spice Crayfish. She says there's no secret to making good crayfish—it's just about using good ingredients and following the right process.
To ensure the freshness of her ingredients, she is very strict about selecting the crayfish. She personally inspects the shrimp delivered each day, keeping only the ones that are fresh, lively, and clean. From washing and preparing to cooking, she handles every step herself because she believes it's the only way to guarantee the best flavor for the final dish served to customers.
Her thirteen-spice recipe was developed through her own years of experience, and the combination of spices follows her specific method. Controlling the heat during cooking is also crucial. Because of this dedication, the crayfish at her shop is very popular with diners, and many become repeat customers after trying it just once.
Besides being the owner, she is more like a chef. She takes the dish of crayfish very seriously. She aims to preserve the traditional Xuyi flavor while also making slight adjustments to suit the tastes of Nanjing locals, allowing more people to enjoy it.
Now, her small shop has become quite well-known in Nanjing's food scene. Many people will drive over from far away just to have a plate of her crayfish.
For her, running this shop is not just about earning a living. It's also about sharing the craft she knows best and is most proud of. When she sees her customers eating with satisfaction, she feels it is the greatest affirmation of her work. Through each plate of crayfish, she conveys her affection for her hometown and her passion for life to the diners of this city.
