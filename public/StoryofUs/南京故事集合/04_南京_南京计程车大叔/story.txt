# 南京计程车大叔 ｜ The Nanjing Taxi Uncle


他是一名网约车司机，每天开车行驶在南京的大街小巷。
他的祖籍在安徽，但从小在南京出生和长大，所以他认为自己就是个南京人。他对这座城市非常熟悉，从秦淮区的夜景到建邺区的现代建筑，再到鼓楼区的历史，他都能随口说出很多故事，就像车上的导航一样精准。
他觉得南京现在已经没什么能让他感觉特别新奇的地方了，但谈到这座城市，他依然有很深的感情。他会告诉乘客，市中心的房价虽然很贵，要六万一平，但那种生活氛围和文化是钱买不到的。
年轻时，他曾在一家台湾老板开的工厂里工作过。那段经历让他印象很深。他记得老板人很好，很和善，每年过完年开工（初五）都会带着大家一起“拜拜”，祈求顺利。老板还会从台湾寄衣服过来，让他帮忙分给南京街头的流浪人员。这些事让他一直很尊敬那位老板，即使过去很多年了，他还是会提起。
后来，他结婚了，回到了江宁区的家里。但为了家庭，也因为喜欢开车在路上的感觉，他又回到了市区，开始开网约车。
现在，他每天载着不同的乘客穿梭在城市里。车上，他喜欢放一些老歌。他的生活，就像这些老歌一样，有对过去的回忆，也有对未来的期盼。对他来说，每一次出车，都是为了生活，也是他对这座城市热爱的一种方式。

A Nanjing Ride-Hailing Driver
He is a ride-hailing driver who drives through the streets and alleys of Nanjing every day.
His ancestral home is in Anhui, but he was born and raised in Nanjing, so he considers himself a Nanjing local. He is very familiar with the city. From the nightscapes of the Qinhuai District to the modern architecture of the Jianye District, and the history of the Gulou District, he can casually tell many stories, as precise as the GPS in his car.
He feels there isn't much in Nanjing that feels particularly new to him anymore, but when he talks about the city, he still has deep affection for it. He will tell passengers that although housing prices in the city center are very expensive, at 60,000 yuan per square meter, the atmosphere of life and the culture there are things money can't buy.
When he was young, he worked in a factory owned by a Taiwanese boss. That experience left a deep impression on him. He remembers the boss was very kind and approachable. Every year, on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year when work resumed, the boss would lead everyone in a "bai bai" (worship) ceremony to pray for a smooth year. The boss would also send clothes from Taiwan and ask him to help distribute them to the homeless people on the streets of Nanjing. These acts have made him respect that boss ever since, and he still brings it up even after many years have passed.
Later, he got married and returned to his home in the Jiangning District. But for the sake of his family, and also because he enjoys the feeling of driving on the road, he came back to the city center and started driving for a ride-hailing service.
Now, he drives different passengers through the city every day. In his car, he likes to play old songs. His life, much like these old songs, holds memories of the past and hopes for the future. For him, every trip is for a living, and it is also a way he expresses his love for this city.
