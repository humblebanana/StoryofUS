# 南京计程车大叔 ｜ The Nanjing Taxi Uncle


在南京，我坐上了一辆网约车。司机是一位中年师傅，他就是这部车的人肉导航，也是这座城市的活地图。
车子平稳地行驶在南京的大街小巷，他随口就能说出每个地方的故事。从秦淮河畔的桨声灯影，到建邺区拔地而起的现代楼宇，再到鼓楼那些藏在梧桐树影里的历史，他都如数家珍。
“我老家是安徽的，但我从小就在南京出生长大，”他握着方向盘，语气平淡，“所以，我就是个南京人。”
他说，对于这座城市，已经没什么能让他感觉特别新奇的地方了，每一条路都跑过无数遍。但当他聊起南京时，话语里又有一种深厚的情感。“市中心房价是贵，六万多一平，”他话锋一转，“但那种生活氛围，那种文化底子，是钱买不到的。”
车子路过一片工业区旧址时，他忽然提起了一段往事。年轻时，他曾在一家台湾老板开的工厂里上过班。那段经历，显然在他心里留下了很深的印记。
“我们老板人很好，很和善，”他回忆道，眼神望向窗外，“每年过完年开工，正月初五，他都会带着我们一起‘拜拜’，就是烧香祈福，求个顺利。” 他顿了顿，又补充了一个细节：“老板还会从台湾寄衣服过来，让我帮忙拿去分给街上的流浪汉。这么多年了，我还是很尊敬他。”
后来，工厂没了，他也结婚回了江宁的家。但为了撑起一个家，也因为放不下这种开车在路上的感觉，他又回到了熟悉的市区，成了一名网-约车司机。


A Nanjing Ride-Hailing Driver
He is a ride-hailing driver who drives through the streets and alleys of Nanjing every day.
His ancestral home is in Anhui, but he was born and raised in Nanjing, so he considers himself a Nanjing local. He is very familiar with the city. From the nightscapes of the Qinhuai District to the modern architecture of the Jianye District, and the history of the Gulou District, he can casually tell many stories, as precise as the GPS in his car.
He feels there isn't much in Nanjing that feels particularly new to him anymore, but when he talks about the city, he still has deep affection for it. He will tell passengers that although housing prices in the city center are very expensive, at 60,000 yuan per square meter, the atmosphere of life and the culture there are things money can't buy.
When he was young, he worked in a factory owned by a Taiwanese boss. That experience left a deep impression on him. He remembers the boss was very kind and approachable. Every year, on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year when work resumed, the boss would lead everyone in a "bai bai" (worship) ceremony to pray for a smooth year. The boss would also send clothes from Taiwan and ask him to help distribute them to the homeless people on the streets of Nanjing. These acts have made him respect that boss ever since, and he still brings it up even after many years have passed.
Later, he got married and returned to his home in the Jiangning District. But for the sake of his family, and also because he enjoys the feeling of driving on the road, he came back to the city center and started driving for a ride-hailing service.
Now, he drives different passengers through the city every day. In his car, he likes to play old songs. His life, much like these old songs, holds memories of the past and hopes for the future. For him, every trip is for a living, and it is also a way he expresses his love for this city.
