# 胜利街路边锅盔店老板娘 ｜ The Guokui Stall Owner on Shengli Street


武汉的胜利街，总有股子人间烟火气。就在这路边，支着一个锅盔摊子，当家的是个女人，襄阳乡下来的。
她在那儿，就像一棵从襄阳的土地上被连根拔起，又硬生生栽进武汉水泥地里的老树。三十年了，风吹日晒，这棵树，活下来了，还活得扎扎实实。
她的手，一看就是干了半辈子活路的手，粗糙，但有力。抓面、揉面、撒芝麻、贴炉膛，一套活儿下来，行云流水，是光阴给的功夫。那烤炉，黑黢黢的，像一头沉默的巨兽，她就从那兽嘴里，掏出一个个滚烫的、焦香的锅盔。
那锅盔，就是最实在的吃食。没啥花哨，一口下去，就是面香、葱香、肉香，扎扎实实地填饱你的肚子。像她这个人，也像她的生活，不讲虚的，只讲实的。
我听说，她一个月就那么点养老金，不够过活。女儿在附近的医院上班，出息了，但她这当妈的，就是闲不住，也或许是不想给孩子添累赘。于是，就守着这个小摊子，一个锅盔三块五块地挣。这钱，挣得不轻松，是拿自己的辛劳，去填补生活那一个个看得见或看不见的窟窿。
于是，这个城市街头最寻常的一幕，就变得有些不一样了。

Wuhan's Shengli Street always has that raw, human smell of smoke and life. On the side of this road, there's a *guokui* stall, run by a woman from the countryside of Xiangyang.

She is there like an old tree, uprooted from the soil of Xiangyang and transplanted by force into the concrete of Wuhan. For thirty years, through wind and sun, this tree has survived. More than survived—it has lived, solidly.

Her hands, you can tell at a glance, are the hands of a woman who has worked for half a lifetime—rough, but strong. Grabbing the dough, kneading it, sprinkling sesame seeds, slapping it onto the oven wall—the whole set of movements flows like water, a skill given only by time. The oven, pitch-black, is like a silent beast, and from its mouth, she pulls out one scorching, fragrant *guokui* after another.

That *guokui* is the most honest kind of food. No frills. One bite, and it's the fragrance of flour, scallions, and meat, filling your stomach in the most solid way. Like her, and like her life—it doesn't deal in vanities, only in what is real.

I've heard her monthly pension is just a pittance, not enough to live on. Her daughter, who has made something of herself, works at a nearby hospital. But this mother, she just can't stay idle—or perhaps, she doesn't want to be a burden to her child. So, she guards this little stall, earning three or five yuan for each *guokui*. This money isn't earned easily; it is her own hard labor, used to fill the visible and invisible holes of life.

And so, this most ordinary scene on a city street becomes something different.
