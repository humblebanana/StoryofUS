# 青年路老废物乐园的调酒师 ｜ The Bartender at Old Rubbish Paradise on Qingnian Road

一个城市，总有那么些角落，像褶皱，收藏着不为人知的光。武汉的青年路，“老废物乐园”——听这名字，像是对一个时代的某种犬儒式回应。而那个一米九的调酒师，就是这褶皱里最安静的一束光。
他站在那里，本身就是一种叙事。巨大的身高和纤细的调酒动作，构成一种奇异的反差。世界在他的吧台前被一分为二：外面是滔滔不绝的言语泡沫，里面是他无一字的专注王国。他低着头，眼神焊在摇壶上，仿佛那里面装着的不是酒，而是一个亟待缝合的宇宙。
他递过来的尼格罗尼，是一份冷峻的邀请。苦，来得毫无防备，像生活偶尔甩来的耳光；甜，姗姗来迟，带着一丝被动的、不情愿的温柔。你喝的不是酒，是一个关于“平衡”的哲学命题。
我听说，他的起点，是后厨堆积如山的杯子。那是一个连面孔都模糊的身份。从洗杯人到调酒师，这不是一个从丑小鸭到天鹅的童话，这是一个现代都市里，个体如何用近乎偏执的纪律，为自己争取一张清晰面孔的真实记录。他没有呐喊什么“梦想”，那太廉价了。他只是日复一日，把一件事情做对，再做对，直到这件事成为他本身。
于是，“老废物乐园”就有了它的“魂”。不是因为那些酒，而是因为那个不说话的人。他用他的沉默和专注告诉你：无论世界如何喧哗、如何“废”，一个人，依然可以凭借自己的手艺，圈出一小块干净、有序、值得尊重的土地。

Every city has its hidden corners, like folds in a fabric, where unseen light is kept. On Qingnian Road in Wuhan, you'll find "Old Rubbish Paradise," a name that feels like a cynical retort to our times. And within this fold, the quietest ray of light is a bartender who stands 190cm tall.
His presence alone tells a story. A strange and beautiful contrast exists between his towering frame and the finesse of his craft. The world is split in two before his bar: on the outside, a ceaseless froth of words; on the inside, his silent kingdom of focus. Head down, his eyes are fixed on the shaker as if it held not mere spirits, but a universe waiting to be mended.
The Negroni he serves is a stern invitation. Its bitterness hits you unguarded, like a sudden slap from life itself. The sweetness arrives later, unhurried, offering a reluctant, almost begrudging, gentleness. What you're drinking isn't just a cocktail; it's a philosophical question about balance.
I'm told he began amidst towering stacks of glasses in the kitchen, an identity so vague as to be faceless. His path from glass washer to mixologist is not some ugly-duckling fable. It is the authentic story of an individual in a modern city, forging a distinct identity for himself through a discipline bordering on obsession. He didn't preach about "dreams"—that would be too cheap. He just did one thing right, day in and day out, until he and his craft became one and the same.
This is how "Old Rubbish Paradise" found its soul. It wasn't the liquor. It was the silent man. Through his quiet concentration, he shows you that no matter how loud and "trashed" the world gets, a single person can, with their own two hands, carve out a small piece of land for themselves that is clean, orderly, and deserving of respect.
