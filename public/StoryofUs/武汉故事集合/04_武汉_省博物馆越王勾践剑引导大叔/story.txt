# 省博物馆越王勾践剑引导大叔 ｜ The Sword Guide at the Provincial Museum

省博物馆那地方，人多，声儿也杂。越王勾践剑的展柜前，更是围得水泄不通。就在这人声鼎沸的涡旋边上，戳着一个男人，馆里的引导员。
他往那一站，就像一棵从地里长出来的树，不多言不多语，身板却直。他的活儿，就是用一句话，去对抗四面八方举起来的手机：“把闪光灯关了。”
那话，是从胸腔里发出来的，平铺直叙，不带拐弯。但奇怪的是，这平淡的调子，却比任何警示牌都有分量。有那么一股子劲儿，像老农挥鞭，看着不重，但鞭梢总能精准地抽在点上，让你心里一凛。
他瞅着那些闪光，眼神里没有恼，也没有怨，就是瞅着。那是一种在田埂上看过半辈子风云的眼神，看惯了天气的阴晴，也看惯了人事的来去。他只是在做一件他认为“该”做的事。这“该”字，就是他的理，他的法度。
于是，一个现代都市里最常见的场景，就变得有些耐人寻味了。
他对抗的，仅仅是那一道道短暂的、刺眼的白光吗？
不。他以一种近乎原始的执拗，对抗着一个时代的通病——一种对历史的轻慢，一种“我来了，我看见了，我拍了照”就算完成的消费式心态。他不懂那些复杂的理论，但他用最朴素的身体语言告诉你：有些东西，你不能这么对它。老祖宗的宝贝，金贵着呢，经不起这么折腾。

The Provincial Museum is a crowded and noisy place. In front of the Sword of Goujian's display case, it's a veritable sea of people. And on the edge of this swirling human vortex, a man stands rooted—a museum guide.
He just stands there, like a tree grown straight from the earth. Not a man of many words, but his posture is ramrod straight. His job is to use a single sentence to fight back against the forest of raised cell phones: "Turn off the flash."
The words come from deep in his chest, flat and direct, no beating around the bush. But strangely, this plain tone carries more weight than any warning sign. It has a certain force to it, like an old farmer cracking a whip—it doesn't look like much, but the tip always lands precisely where it should, making you flinch inwardly.
He stares at the flashes, his eyes showing neither anger nor complaint. He just stares. It's the gaze of a man who has watched the world's storms from a field ridge for half a lifetime, accustomed to the changing skies and the comings and goings of people. He is simply doing what he believes ought to be done. This word, "ought," is his principle, his law.
And so, a most common scene in a modern city becomes something worth pondering.
Is he merely fighting against those brief, harsh flashes of white light?
No. With an almost primal stubbornness, he is fighting a sickness of our era—a casual disregard for history, a consumerist mentality that believes "I came, I saw, I took a photo" is enough. He doesn't understand the complex theories, but he tells you with the plainest body language: You can't treat some things this way. The treasures of our ancestors are precious; they can't withstand this kind of rough handling.
