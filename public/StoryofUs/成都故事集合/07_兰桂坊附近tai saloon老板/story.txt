兰桂坊附近tai saloon老板｜The Owner of Tai Saloon Near Lan Kwai Fong

二十一年前，他带着一颗勇敢的心从台湾高雄来到成都。从在Sage工作的那个年轻人，到现在拥有自己酒吧"Tai Saloon"的老板，这一路走来充满了坚持和梦想。

他把台湾的温暖带到了这里，酒吧里的每一个装饰都诉说着家乡的故事。"成都的女孩啊，不仅漂亮，性格还直爽，让人很舒服，"他笑着说，眼中满是对这座城市的喜爱。

他调制的"纸飞机"鸡尾酒，用威士忌做基酒，酸甜中带着海岛的清新。每当夜幕降临，Tai Saloon就成了一个温暖的港湾，人们在这里分享着各自的故事，而他则用自己的热情为这座城市的夜晚增添着温度。在他身上，我看到了两岸文化的美好融合，也感受到了成都这座城市的包容与温暖。

Twenty-one years ago, he came to Chengdu from Kaohsiung, Taiwan with a brave heart. From the young man working at Sage to now owning his own bar "Tai Saloon," this journey has been filled with persistence and dreams.

He brought Taiwan's warmth here, with every decoration in the bar telling stories of his hometown. "Chengdu girls are not only beautiful but also straightforward, making people feel comfortable," he says with a smile, his eyes full of love for this city.

His "Paper Plane" cocktail, made with whiskey as the base, carries the freshness of islands in its sweet and sour taste. When night falls, Tai Saloon becomes a warm harbor where people share their stories, while he adds warmth to the city's nights with his passion. In him, I see the beautiful fusion of cross-strait cultures and feel Chengdu's tolerance and warmth.
