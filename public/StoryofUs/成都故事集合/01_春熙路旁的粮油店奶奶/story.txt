春熙路旁的粮油店奶奶｜The Grain and Oil Shop Grandma by Chunxi Road

在春熙路的喧嚣中，有一家小小的粮油店，店主是一位从德阳来的奶奶。她的手因为多年的劳作而粗糙，但每次为顾客称米称油时，动作却格外轻柔细致。从环卫工人到小店老板，这个转变对她来说不只是职业的改变，更像是在这座城市里找到了属于自己的位置。

儿子总是心疼她，劝她不要这么辛苦，但她总是笑着摇头。"这店啊，不只是为了赚钱，"她一边整理货架一边说，"是让我觉得自己还有用，还能照顾你们。"岁月虽然在她脸上刻下了皱纹，但她的眼神里依然有着对明天的期待。在这个快节奏的城市里，她用自己的方式守护着一份朴素的温暖。

In the hustle and bustle of Chunxi Road, there's a small grain and oil shop run by a grandmother from Deyang. Her hands are rough from years of labor, but when weighing rice and oil for customers, her movements are exceptionally gentle and meticulous. The transition from sanitation worker to shop owner means more than just a career change for her - it's like finding her own place in this city.

Her son always feels sorry for her and advises her not to work so hard, but she always smiles and shakes her head. "This shop isn't just about making money," she says while organizing the shelves, "it makes me feel useful, that I can still take care of you all." Though time has carved wrinkles on her face, her eyes still hold anticipation for tomorrow. In this fast-paced city, she guards a simple warmth in her own way.
