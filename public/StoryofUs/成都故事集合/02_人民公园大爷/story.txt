人民公园大爷｜The Sage of People's Park

午后，人民公园的石桌上，梧桐叶影斑驳。一位从绵阳来的老人，坐在广场旁的一块石头上，慢悠悠地品着茶。他没有谈及高深的学问，但言语间自有一种沉静的力量。他望向远处的湖面，说：“成都人，最看重心里那份满足。”

他提到，赚钱是为了让日子过得更舒心，而非被其束缚。谈到感情，他只用了“真诚”二字。他还认为，理解他人，便是理解自己，人际间的和谐由此而生。

临别时，他推荐我去看看欢乐谷的《抓壮丁》，说那里面藏着许多做人的道理。我心想一个比我大快60岁的人，居然比我还会玩，我看着他慈祥的笑容，那笑容里，似乎蕴含着这座城市不急不躁的安逸。

In the hustle and bustle of Chunxi Road, there's a small grain and oil shop run by a grandmother from Deyang. Her hands are rough from years of labor, but when weighing rice and oil for customers, her movements are exceptionally gentle and meticulous. The transition from sanitation worker to shop owner means more than just a career change for her - it's like finding her own place in this city.

Her son always feels sorry for her and advises her not to work so hard, but she always smiles and shakes his head. "This shop isn't just about making money," she says while organizing the shelves, "it makes me feel useful, that I can still take care of you all." Though time has carved wrinkles on her face, her eyes still hold anticipation for tomorrow. In this fast-paced city, she guards a simple warmth in her own way.
