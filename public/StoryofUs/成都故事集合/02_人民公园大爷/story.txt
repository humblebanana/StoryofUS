人民公园大爷｜The Sage of People's Park

午后的阳光透过梧桐叶洒在石桌上，这位从绵阳来的大爷正悠然地品着茶。他没有什么高深的学问，但说起话来却有着让人心安的力量。"成都人啊，最懂得什么叫精神富足，"他慢悠悠地说，眼神望向远处的湖面，"心里满足了，比什么都强。"

他告诉我，赚钱只是为了让生活更快乐，而不是被钱绑架了生活。说到感情时，他只用了两个字："真诚。"简单却有分量。他还提到心理学的重要性，说理解别人就是理解自己，人与人之间的和谐就是这样来的。

临别时，他推荐我看《抓壮丁》，说那里面有很多做人的道理。看着他慈祥的笑容，我想，这就是成都的温度吧——不急不躁，却能温暖人心。

The afternoon sunlight filters through the sycamore leaves onto the stone table, where this elderly man from Mianyang sits leisurely sipping tea. He doesn't have profound knowledge, but his words carry a power that puts people at ease. "Chengdu people understand what spiritual wealth means," he says slowly, gazing toward the distant lake, "when your heart is content, that's stronger than anything."

He tells me that making money is just to make life happier, not to be enslaved by money. When talking about relationships, he uses only two words: "Sincerity." Simple yet weighty. He also mentions the importance of psychology, saying that understanding others is understanding yourself, and harmony between people comes from this.

Before parting, he recommends I watch "Zhuang Zhuang Ding," saying it contains many principles of being human. Looking at his kind smile, I think this is Chengdu's warmth - unhurried and unrushed, yet able to warm the heart.
