街口蹄花摊偶遇的搞事业姐姐｜The Ambitious Sister I Met at the Pig's Trotter Stall

夜深了，成都街头的一个蹄花摊子，热气和人声混在一起，向上蒸腾。
摊前的座位不多，几张矮桌被人挨人地占着。我和她几乎同时在寻找最后一张空凳，目光对上，都有些窘迫，然后便自然地拼了一桌。
她点了雪豆蹄花和一份凉拌猪耳。摊主端上来，她便低头吃起来，一筷子蹄花，一筷子猪耳，动作很安静，也很专注。在那份专注里，看不到周遭的热闹，仿佛整个世界只剩下眼前那碗汤。
我们断断续续地聊了几句。她说，她正在满城找铺面，想开一家自己的小馆子。
“想做点自己喜欢的事。” 她说这话时，语气很平淡，就像在谈论天气，或者今晚的蹄花味道不错。她顿了顿，又补了一句：“是成都给了我这个念头。”
一碗蹄花吃完，汤也喝尽。她放下筷子，说了声“我走了”，便起身离开，很快就消失在街上的人流里。我看着她的方向，那个背影在喧闹的灯火和人影中，显得很小，但走得很稳。
我继续坐在那里，摊主还在忙着给新来的客人舀汤，旁边一桌的人在大声划拳。一切都没有变化。只是刚才，有一个想开馆子的女人在这里吃完了一顿饭，然后继续去为她的店奔走了。

At an inconspicuous pig's trotter stall on a Chengdu street, I met her. It was lunchtime, and seats at the small stall were tight. We smiled at each other over our shared "no seats" situation and decided to share a table.

She ordered pig's trotters and pig's ears, eating with focus, but her eyes held a determined light. Through our conversation, I learned she was searching the city for a suitable storefront, preparing to open her own restaurant. "I want to do something I love," she said while eating, "this city of Chengdu has given me courage."

After quickly finishing her meal, she got up to say goodbye and continued her shop-hunting journey. Watching her departing figure, I was deeply moved by that persistence toward dreams. In this city full of life's essence, everyone pursues their dreams in their own way, and her determination made this ordinary lunch extraordinarily warm.
