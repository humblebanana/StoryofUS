街口蹄花摊偶遇的搞事业姐姐｜The Ambitious Sister I Met at the Pig's Trotter Stall

在成都街头一个不起眼的蹄花摊前，我遇到了她。那时正值午餐时间，小摊前座位紧张，我们因为同样的"没座位"而相视一笑，决定拼桌吃饭。

她点了蹄花和猪耳朵，吃得很专注，但眼神里透着一种坚定的光芒。聊天中得知，她正在满城寻找合适的店面，准备开一家属于自己的餐厅。"我想做点自己喜欢的事情，"她一边吃一边说，"成都这座城市给了我勇气。"

匆匆吃完，她就起身告别，继续她的寻店之旅。看着她离去的背影，我被那种对梦想的执着深深感动。在这座充满烟火气的城市里，每个人都在用自己的方式追逐着梦想，而她的坚持让这个平凡的午餐变得格外温暖。

At an inconspicuous pig's trotter stall on a Chengdu street, I met her. It was lunchtime, and seats at the small stall were tight. We smiled at each other over our shared "no seats" situation and decided to share a table.

She ordered pig's trotters and pig's ears, eating with focus, but her eyes held a determined light. Through our conversation, I learned she was searching the city for a suitable storefront, preparing to open her own restaurant. "I want to do something I love," she said while eating, "this city of Chengdu has given me courage."

After quickly finishing her meal, she got up to say goodbye and continued her shop-hunting journey. Watching her departing figure, I was deeply moved by that persistence toward dreams. In this city full of life's essence, everyone pursues their dreams in their own way, and her determination made this ordinary lunch extraordinarily warm.
