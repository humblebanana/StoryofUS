街口蹄花摊偶遇的搞事业姐姐｜The Ambitious Sister I Met at the Pig's Trotter Stall

晚间的成都街头，一个不起眼的蹄花摊，人声与热气一同蒸腾。座位是稀缺的，我与她因同样的窘迫相视，随即拼了桌。
她点了蹄花、猪耳朵，一筷一箸，吃得安静而专注。那份专注里，有一种奇异的定力。我们交谈起来，得知她正满城寻觅铺面，要开一家自己的馆子。
“想做点自己喜欢的事。”她语气平淡，仿佛在说一件再寻常不过的日常，“是成都给了我这个念头。”
饭毕，她便起身告辞，融进了街上的人流，继续她那场一个人的“出征”。我看着那个背影，在喧闹的市井中，显得既微小又坚定。
这座城市就是这样，在最寻常的烟火气里，总能撞见一些为自己生命用力的灵魂。

At an inconspicuous pig's trotter stall on a Chengdu street, I met her. It was lunchtime, and seats at the small stall were tight. We smiled at each other over our shared "no seats" situation and decided to share a table.

She ordered pig's trotters and pig's ears, eating with focus, but her eyes held a determined light. Through our conversation, I learned she was searching the city for a suitable storefront, preparing to open her own restaurant. "I want to do something I love," she said while eating, "this city of Chengdu has given me courage."

After quickly finishing her meal, she got up to say goodbye and continued her shop-hunting journey. Watching her departing figure, I was deeply moved by that persistence toward dreams. In this city full of life's essence, everyone pursues their dreams in their own way, and her determination made this ordinary lunch extraordinarily warm.
