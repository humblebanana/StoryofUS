兰桂坊附近花莲小站老板｜The Owner of Hualian Xiaozhan Near Lan Kwai Fong

在兰桂坊的繁华背后，有一家叫"花莲小站"的小店，老板是位来自台湾彰化的中年人。二十年的时光，他已经深深爱上了成都的悠闲与温润，爱上了这里湿润的空气和麻辣的味道。

店名承载着前任老板的故事——一个地道的花莲人。虽然那位老板已经离开，但这个名字和它背后的温暖却留了下来。他的家人还在台湾，自己也很久没有回去了，但他用这家小店默默维系着与家乡的联系。

每一道台湾菜，都是他对家乡的思念，也是他给成都人的一份礼物。在这座包容万物的城市里，"花莲小站"不只是一家餐厅，更是一座连接两岸情感的桥梁，让每个品尝的人都能感受到那份跨越海峡的温暖。

Behind the bustling Lan Kwai Fong, there's a small shop called "Hualian Xiaozhan," owned by a middle-aged man from Changhua, Taiwan. Twenty years have passed, and he has deeply fallen in love with Chengdu's leisure and gentleness, with its humid air and spicy flavors.

The shop name carries the story of the previous owner - a genuine Hualian native. Although that owner has left, the name and the warmth behind it remain. His family is still in Taiwan, and he hasn't been back for a long time, but he silently maintains his connection to his hometown through this small shop.

Every Taiwanese dish is his longing for home and a gift to the people of Chengdu. In this inclusive city, "Hualian Xiaozhan" is not just a restaurant, but a bridge connecting cross-strait emotions, letting everyone who tastes the food feel that warmth across the strait.
