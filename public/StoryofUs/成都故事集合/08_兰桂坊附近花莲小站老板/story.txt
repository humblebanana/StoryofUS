兰桂坊附近花莲小站老板｜The Owner of Hualian Xiaozhan Near Lan Kwai Fong

在兰桂坊一带，穿过热闹的主街，能找到一家叫“花莲小站”的食店。
店里主事的是个中年男人，来自台湾彰化。他在成都待了二十年，已经习惯了这里的一切。他会说起成都空气的湿润，不像台湾那样带着咸味；也会说起这里的麻辣，起初不适，现在却离不开。
“花莲小站”这个名字，是上一任店主留下的。那位店主是花莲人，后来离开了成都。他盘下店面时，没有把招牌换掉。
他的家人没跟他过来，都在台湾。算起来，他也有很长一段时间没回去了。每天的生活，就是围绕着这家店展开。他把大部分时间花在厨房，把一道道台湾菜做出来。卤肉饭的肉燥要小火慢炖，三杯鸡的火候要恰到好处。
食客们来了又走，谈论着菜的味道，或是自己的生活。对他而言，这家店是他与故乡的一种联系。一个彰化人，在成都，开着一家叫“花莲小站”的店。这件事本身，就像他做的菜一样，混合了不同的来处，最终成了成都街头一个具体的、可以品尝的味道。

Behind the bustling Lan Kwai Fong, there's a small shop called "Hualian Xiaozhan," owned by a middle-aged man from Changhua, Taiwan. Twenty years have passed, and he has deeply fallen in love with Chengdu's leisure and gentleness, with its humid air and spicy flavors.

The shop name carries the story of the previous owner - a genuine Hualian native. Although that owner has left, the name and the warmth behind it remain. His family is still in Taiwan, and he hasn't been back for a long time, but he silently maintains his connection to his hometown through this small shop.

Every Taiwanese dish is his longing for home and a gift to the people of Chengdu. In this inclusive city, "Hualian Xiaozhan" is not just a restaurant, but a bridge connecting cross-strait emotions, letting everyone who tastes the food feel that warmth across the strait.
