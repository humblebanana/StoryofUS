太古里Mondonli的新媒体姊姊｜The New Media Sister at Mondonli in Taikoo Li

她是成都的女儿，身上有着这座城市独有的温婉。曾经为了梦想远赴深圳，但最终还是被家乡的温暖拉了回来。现在她在太古里的Mondonli工作，用相机和文字记录着成都的美好。

她拍照时总有一种特别的气质，复古而优雅，像是从老电影里走出来的人。聊天时，她的眼睛会发光，特别是在教我成都方言的时候。"脏在成都话里叫'得儿体'，"她笑着说，然后又调皮地教了我一句重庆话"包痞隆"，那种纯真的快乐感染着周围的人。

她说，用方言写作能让文字更有温度，更贴近生活。在她的镜头和文字里，成都不只是一座城市，更是一个有温度、有故事的家。

She is Chengdu's daughter, carrying the city's unique gentleness. She once went to Shenzhen for her dreams, but was eventually pulled back by the warmth of her hometown. Now she works at Mondonli in Taikoo Li, documenting Chengdu's beauty with her camera and words.

When taking photos, she always has a special temperament - vintage and elegant, like someone who walked out of an old movie. When chatting, her eyes light up, especially when teaching me Chengdu dialect. "Dirty in Chengdu dialect is called 'de er ti,'" she says with a smile, then mischievously teaches me a Chongqing phrase "bao pi long," that pure joy infectious to those around her.

She says using dialect in writing makes the words warmer and closer to life. Through her lens and words, Chengdu is not just a city, but a home with warmth and stories.
