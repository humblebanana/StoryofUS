春熙路巷弄里古着店小哥｜The Vintage Store Guy in Chunxi Road Alley

在春熙路深处的小巷里，有一家古着店，店主是个从甘肃来的小伙子。他身上有着西北人特有的爽朗，笑起来眼角会弯成月牙。店里的每件衣服都像是时光的信使，静静诉说着过往的故事。

"成都这地方好，离家不远，年轻人多，有活力。"他一边整理衣架一边说，语气里满是对这座城市的喜爱。当我问起成都的夜生活时，他眼睛一亮，热情地推荐了几家酒吧和可以听嘻哈音乐的地方，那种发自内心的分享让人感到温暖。

他的声音里有着西北的豪迈，但在成都的温润中又多了几分柔和。就像他店里那些老物件，经过时间的洗礼，反而更有味道，更有故事。

In a small alley deep in Chunxi Road, there's a vintage store owned by a young man from Gansu. He carries the characteristic straightforwardness of people from the northwest, and when he smiles, his eyes curve into crescents. Every piece of clothing in the shop is like a messenger of time, quietly telling stories of the past.

"Chengdu is a good place - not far from home, lots of young people, full of vitality," he says while organizing the clothes rack, his tone full of love for this city. When I ask about Chengdu's nightlife, his eyes light up as he enthusiastically recommends several bars and places to listen to hip-hop music, that heartfelt sharing making people feel warm.

His voice carries the boldness of the northwest, but in Chengdu's gentleness, it has gained a touch of softness. Just like the old items in his store - after being washed by time, they become more flavorful and story-rich.
