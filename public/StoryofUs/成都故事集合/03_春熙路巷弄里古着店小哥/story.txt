春熙路巷弄里古着店小哥｜The Vintage Store Guy in Chunxi Road Alley

春熙路深处的小巷，有家古着店，店主是个来自甘肃的小伙子。他说话爽朗，笑时眼角弯弯，像是西北的风吹进成都的午后。

“成都挺好，离家近，年轻人多，很有活力。”他边整理衣架边说，语气平和，像是在陈述一件日常。问到夜生活，他眼里闪过一丝兴奋，随口推荐了几家酒吧和听嘻哈的地方，语气自然，没有刻意的热情。

他的声音里有西北的爽快，也有成都的温润。店里的衣服安静地挂着，仿佛每一件都藏着一段旧时光。

In a quiet alley off Chunxi Road, a vintage shop stands, run by a young man from Gansu. His words are direct, his smile gentle, carrying a hint of the northwest in Chengdu’s afternoon light. Clothes hang silently, each one holding a fragment of time.

"Chengdu is nice, close to home, lots of young people, full of energy." He says this while tidying the racks, his tone calm, as if stating a simple fact. When asked about nightlife, a spark appears in his eyes; he casually mentions a few bars and places for hip-hop, his sharing natural, without deliberate warmth.

His voice blends the straightforwardness of the northwest with the softness of Chengdu. The old items rest quietly in the shop, marked by time, carrying their own stories.
