三圣面偶遇的北京三口｜The Beijing Family I Met at Sansheng Noodles

在三圣面馆里，我遇到了这一家三口北京游客。他们刚从都江堰回来，脸上还带着旅途的兴奋和疲惫。父亲生动地描述着都江堰的人山人海，"那人啊，比江水还要汹涌！"母亲在一旁笑着补充，孩子则好奇地打量着周围的一切。

他们对成都的印象让我印象深刻：火辣辣的美食、慢悠悠的生活节奏，还有建设路上那些香气四溢的小吃摊。"这里的老人家下棋特别悠闲，"孩子天真地说，"跟北京不一样。"

听着他们一家人的对话，我感受到了旅行的美好——不只是看风景，更是体验不同的生活方式，感受不同城市的温度。他们的快乐是那么纯真，让这顿简单的面条都变得温暖起来。

At Sansheng Noodles, I met this family of three tourists from Beijing. They had just returned from Dujiangyan, their faces still showing the excitement and fatigue of travel. The father vividly described the crowds at Dujiangyan, "Those people were more turbulent than the river water!" The mother laughed and added details while the child curiously observed everything around.

Their impression of Chengdu impressed me: spicy food, leisurely pace of life, and those fragrant snack stalls on Jianshe Road. "The elderly here play chess so leisurely," the child said innocently, "it's different from Beijing."

Listening to their family conversation, I felt the beauty of travel - not just seeing scenery, but experiencing different lifestyles and feeling the warmth of different cities. Their joy was so pure that it made even this simple bowl of noodles feel warm.
