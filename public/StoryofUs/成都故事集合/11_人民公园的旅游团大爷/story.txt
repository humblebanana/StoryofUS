人民公园的旅游团大爷｜The Tour Group Elder in People's Park

在人民公园的石桌旁，我遇到了这位来自淄博的大爷。他和老伴正在休息，两人相视而笑的样子让人感到温暖。几十年的相伴，让他们之间有了一种默契的温柔。

"成都的气候真好，"大爷慢慢地说，"这里的生活节奏也让人舒服。"虽然年纪大了，但他的精神状态很好，眼神里依然有着对生活的热爱。疫情那几年虽然不容易，但他们夫妻俩相互扶持，一起走了过来。

"人啊，到了这个年纪，最重要的就是身体健康，家人平安，"他拍拍老伴的手说。看着他们相依相伴的样子，我想，这就是最朴素也最珍贵的幸福吧——有人陪伴，有地方可去，有美好可以分享。

By the stone table in People's Park, I met this elderly man from Zibo. He and his wife were resting, and the way they looked at each other and smiled made people feel warm. Decades of companionship have given them a tacit tenderness.

"Chengdu's climate is really nice," the elderly man said slowly, "the pace of life here is also comfortable." Although he's getting older, his mental state is good, and his eyes still hold love for life. Those pandemic years weren't easy, but the couple supported each other and got through it together.

"At our age, the most important things are good health and family safety," he said, patting his wife's hand. Watching them depend on each other, I thought this is the most simple yet precious happiness - having someone to accompany you, places to go, and beauty to share.
