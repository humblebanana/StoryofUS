建设路的摆摊教培姐姐｜The Tutoring Sister at Jianshe Road

在建设路的街头，有一个特别的摊位，摊主是位来自甘肃的姐姐。她的摊位上没有小吃零食，而是摆着书本和学习用品——她在这里做教育培训。

她曾经是电台主持人，声音温暖动听，陪伴过无数人度过夜晚的时光。后来她选择了教育这条路，觉得用知识和文化来温暖人心更有意义。"孩子们需要的不只是知识，更需要正确的人生态度，"她温和地说。

她也会在摊位上卖一些汤圆和淀粉肠，简单的小食却做得用心。就像她的人生哲学一样，简单中见真情，平凡中显温暖。路过的孩子们都喜欢她，不只是因为她教得好，更因为她身上那种温暖的力量。

在这个快节奏的城市里，她用自己的方式守护着一份教育的初心，让每个遇到她的人都能感受到知识的温度和文化的力量。

On Jianshe Road, there's a special stall run by a sister from Gansu. Her stall doesn't have snacks or treats, but books and learning materials - she does educational tutoring here.

She used to be a radio host with a warm, pleasant voice that accompanied countless people through their evenings. Later she chose the path of education, feeling that warming hearts with knowledge and culture was more meaningful. "Children need not just knowledge, but the right attitude toward life," she says gently.

She also sells some tangyuan and starch sausages at her stall, simple food made with care. Just like her life philosophy - genuine feelings found in simplicity, warmth shown in the ordinary. Children passing by all like her, not just because she teaches well, but because of the warm power she carries.

In this fast-paced city, she guards the original intention of education in her own way, letting everyone who meets her feel the warmth of knowledge and the power of culture.
