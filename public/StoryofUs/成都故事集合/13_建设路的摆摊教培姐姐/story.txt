建设路的摆摊教培姐姐｜The Tutoring Sister at Jianshe Road

在建设路的街边，有一个摊位。摊主是位来自甘肃的女性。
她的摊位上，除了书本和学习资料，也卖汤圆和淀粉肠。
与人交谈时，能听出她的声音很清晰，语调温和。她说，她以前是电台主持人。后来，她选择了做教育。
她提到：“孩子们需要的不只是知识，更需要正确的人生态度。”
她一边说着，一边给锅里的汤圆翻个身，或者给淀粉肠刷上酱料。食物很简单，但她做得不紧不慢，每个步骤都很认真。
路过的人，有些会买一份小吃，有些会停下来询问关于孩子学习的事情。她都会停下手里的活，抬头回答他们的问题。


On Jianshe Road, there's a special stall run by a sister from Gansu. Her stall doesn't have snacks or treats, but books and learning materials - she does educational tutoring here.

She used to be a radio host with a warm, pleasant voice that accompanied countless people through their evenings. Later she chose the path of education, feeling that warming hearts with knowledge and culture was more meaningful. "Children need not just knowledge, but the right attitude toward life," she says gently.

She also sells some tangyuan and starch sausages at her stall, simple food made with care. Just like her life philosophy - genuine feelings found in simplicity, warmth shown in the ordinary. Children passing by all like her, not just because she teaches well, but because of the warm power she carries.

In this fast-paced city, she guards the original intention of education in her own way, letting everyone who meets her feel the warmth of knowledge and the power of culture.
