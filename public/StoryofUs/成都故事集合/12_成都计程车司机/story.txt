成都计程车司机｜The Chengdu Taxi Driver

他是土生土长的成都人，开了二十年出租车。每天穿梭在城市的大街小巷，见证着成都的变化。他的四川话说得特别地道，聊起成都来如数家珍。

"天府那边的房价啊，真的是高得吓人，"他一边开车一边说，"但是武侯、锦江这些老城区还算稳定。"他对成都年轻人的生活方式很了解："周一到周五好好上班，周五晚上就和朋友聚会，该玩的时候就玩，该工作的时候就工作。"

二十年来，他载过无数的乘客，每个人都有自己的故事。"有时候听乘客聊天，就像在听成都的故事，"他笑着说。在他眼里，成都既有繁华热闹的一面，也有温柔平静的一面。

他不只是司机，更像是这座城市的记忆守护者。每一次载客，都是在传递成都的温度，让每个坐他车的人都能感受到这座城市的温暖。

He's a native Chengdu person who has been driving a taxi for twenty years. Every day he shuttles through the city's streets and alleys, witnessing Chengdu's changes. His Sichuan dialect is particularly authentic, and he knows Chengdu like the back of his hand.

"The housing prices in Tianfu area are really scary high," he says while driving, "but the old districts like Wuhou and Jinjiang are still relatively stable." He understands the lifestyle of Chengdu's young people well: "Work hard Monday to Friday, then gather with friends on Friday nights - play when it's time to play, work when it's time to work."

Over twenty years, he has carried countless passengers, each with their own story. "Sometimes listening to passengers chat is like listening to Chengdu's stories," he says with a smile. In his eyes, Chengdu has both bustling lively sides and gentle peaceful sides.

He's not just a driver, but more like a guardian of this city's memories. Every ride is about conveying Chengdu's warmth, letting everyone who takes his taxi feel the city's warmth.
