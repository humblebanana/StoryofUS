太古里Mondonli小哥｜The Young Man at Mondonli in Taikoo Li

他来自维吾尔，身上带着远方的风与阳光，落脚在成都

太古里Mondonli咖啡厅的日常，似乎已经不能没有他。他不是那种刻意招徕的热情，更像清晨时分，从叶隙间漏下的第一缕光，你一抬头，便觉得安然、温暖。

他跟我分享到，他的清晨，是从一杯干红开始的。阳光斜斜地照进来，落在杯壁上，也落在他安静的侧脸上，这仿佛是他与这座城市一同苏醒的默契。他尤其偏爱波本威士忌的香气，那是一种混合着橡木、焦糖与时光的味道。每当他向客人聊起时，眼里会亮起一种光，不是出于职业的推荐，而是分享心爱之物的真诚，纯粹得令人动容。

在这里，他很少被看作一个单纯的服务员。他更像一座桥，无声地立在那里，一头连着遥远的故土，一头连着眼前成都的烟火人间。走进Mondonli的客人，无论是匆匆一瞥还是短暂交谈，似乎都能从他身上，感受到一种由内而外的平和与暖意。

He is Uyghur, bringing warmth from afar to Chengdu. At Mondonli in Taikoo Li, he has become an indispensable part of this place, like the first ray of morning sunlight - natural and warm.

Every morning, he enjoys a glass of dry red wine with the sunlight, a ritual of waking up together with this city. He particularly loves the aroma of bourbon whiskey, and when recommending it to guests, his eyes sparkle with sincere light, that heartfelt passion touching people's hearts.

Here, he's not just a waiter, but more like a bridge connecting different cultures and souls. Every guest who enters Mondonli can feel that warmth from afar through him, as well as Chengdu's inclusive embrace of all things. In his own way, he makes every encounter special and warm.
