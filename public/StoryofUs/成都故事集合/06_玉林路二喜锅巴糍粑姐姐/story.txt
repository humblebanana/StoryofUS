玉林路二喜锅巴糍粑姐姐｜The Sister of Erxi Guoba Ci at Yulin Road

在玉林路的街头，有一家小店叫"二喜锅巴糍粑"，店主是位从攀枝花来的姐姐。十五年了，她在这里用心经营着自己的小天地。最初学着贵州的做法做糍粑，后来慢慢加入了自己的想法，创造出了各种口味。

每天清晨，她总是第一个到店里，准备着一天的食材。无论是炎热的夏日还是人潮涌动的节假日，她总是笑脸相迎每一位客人，那种发自内心的热情让人感到温暖。"做吃的嘛，就是要用心，"她一边忙碌一边说，"客人吃得开心，我就开心。"

她的糍粑不只是食物，更像是一份温暖的情意。在这个快节奏的城市里，她用自己的方式守护着一份朴素的美好，让每个路过的人都能感受到家的温暖。

On Yulin Road, there's a small shop called "Erxi Guoba Ci," run by a sister from Panzhihua. For fifteen years, she has been carefully managing her little world here. Initially learning Guizhou's method to make ci, she gradually added her own ideas, creating various flavors.

Every morning, she's always the first to arrive at the shop, preparing the day's ingredients. Whether it's a hot summer day or crowded holidays, she always greets every customer with a smile, that heartfelt warmth making people feel at ease. "When making food, you have to put your heart into it," she says while busy working, "when customers are happy eating, I'm happy."

Her ci is not just food, but more like a warm sentiment. In this fast-paced city, she guards a simple beauty in her own way, letting every passerby feel the warmth of home.
