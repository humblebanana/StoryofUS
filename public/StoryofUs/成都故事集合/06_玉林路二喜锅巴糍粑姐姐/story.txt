玉林路二喜锅巴糍粑姐姐｜The Sister of Erxi Guoba Ci at Yulin Road


玉林路的街头，总是不缺热闹的故事。在这些故事的一角，有一家小店，名叫“二喜锅巴糍粑”。
店主是位从攀枝花来的姐姐，在这里，一晃就是十五年。时间像街上的人流一样来来去去，她却始终守着这个小小的灶台，守着自己的小天地。最初，她跟着贵州师傅学手艺，后来，日子久了，想法多了，便开始往糍粑里注入自己的心思，一种又一种的新口味，就这样在烟火气中诞生了。
每天清晨，当整条街还在沉睡时，她店里的灯光就先亮了。那是她在为一天的生计做准备，淘米、磨浆、调味，每一个动作都重复了上万次，早已成为身体的本能。无论是酷暑难当的夏日，还是节假日里汹涌的人潮，你总能看到她带着笑意的脸庞，那份热情不是生意人的客套，而是一种发自心底的、对生活的热忱。
“做吃的嘛，用心最要紧，”她一边在滚烫的油锅边忙碌，一边头也不抬地说，“客人吃得高兴，我心里就舒坦了。” 话语朴素，像她手里的糍粑一样，实在。

On Yulin Road, there's a small shop called "Erxi Guoba Ci," run by a sister from Panzhihua. For fifteen years, she has been carefully managing her little world here. Initially learning Guizhou's method to make ci, she gradually added her own ideas, creating various flavors.

Every morning, she's always the first to arrive at the shop, preparing the day's ingredients. Whether it's a hot summer day or crowded holidays, she always greets every customer with a smile, that heartfelt warmth making people feel at ease. "When making food, you have to put your heart into it," she says while busy working, "when customers are happy eating, I'm happy."

Her ci is not just food, but more like a warm sentiment. In this fast-paced city, she guards a simple beauty in her own way, letting every passerby feel the warmth of home.
