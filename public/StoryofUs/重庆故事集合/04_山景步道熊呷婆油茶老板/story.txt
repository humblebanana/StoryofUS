山景步道熊呷婆油茶老板｜The Bear Granny Oil Tea Shop Owner on Mountain View Trail

在重庆的山景步道上，有一家专门做传统油茶的小店，老板是个很有热情的人。这家店承载着很多重庆人的童年记忆，也见证了山城巷子的变迁。

老板手艺很好，能把简单的食材做成一碗碗温暖人心的油茶。每一口都有山城的味道，每一碗都有熊呷婆的故事。他既坚持传统做法，又不断创新，让每个来的客人都能感受到山城的温暖和热情。

他的故事就像他做的油茶一样，经过了岁月的熬煮，变得更加醇厚。这家店不只是吃东西的地方，更是传递文化和情感的地方。每个来这里的人，都能感受到那份来自山城深处的温暖。

老板常说，做油茶就像做人一样，要用心，要坚持。看着他专注地调制每一碗油茶的样子，我想，这就是匠人精神吧——在平凡中坚守，在传承中创新。

On Chongqing's Mountain View Trail, there's a small shop specializing in traditional oil tea, run by a very passionate owner. This shop carries many Chongqing people's childhood memories and has witnessed the changes in the mountain city's alleys.

The owner has great skills, able to turn simple ingredients into bowls of heart-warming oil tea. Every sip has the taste of the mountain city, every bowl has the story of Bear Granny. He both maintains traditional methods and continuously innovates, letting every customer feel the warmth and enthusiasm of the mountain city.

His story is like the oil tea he makes - after being simmered by the years, it has become richer and fuller. This shop is not just a place to eat, but a place to convey culture and emotions. Everyone who comes here can feel that warmth from deep within the mountain city.

The owner often says that making oil tea is like being a person - you must put your heart into it and persist. Watching him focus on preparing each bowl of oil tea, I think this is the craftsman's spirit - persisting in the ordinary, innovating in inheritance.
