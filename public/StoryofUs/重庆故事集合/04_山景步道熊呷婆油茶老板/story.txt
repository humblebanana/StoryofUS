山景步道熊呷婆油茶老板｜The Bear Granny Oil Tea Shop Owner on Mountain View Trail

在重庆，要寻访一座城市的记忆，有时需要往上走。在一条蜿蜒的山景步道上，我找到了一家专门做传统油茶的小店。
店不大，藏在巷子的深处，若不是被那股特有的米糊香气指引，很容易错过。老板是个热情的中年人，你只要往店门口一站，他就会用带着笑意的声音招呼你。这家店在这里有些年头了，很多本地人说，这是他们从小吃到大的味道。它就像这山城巷子里的一块老石头，安静地看着周围的店铺开了又关，游人来了又走。
老板的手艺很好。米糊、馓子、大头菜、花生……这些再寻常不过的食材，在他手里，经过一道道熟练的工序，就成了一碗热气腾腾、能暖到心底的油茶。他一边忙活，一边会跟你聊起“熊呷婆”（外婆）的故事，说这手艺就是从老一辈那里传下来的。
他坚持用最传统的方法熬制米糊，但也会根据年轻人的口味，在配料上做些微调。他做的油茶，就像他这个人，既有老重庆的根，也乐于拥抱新的变化。
他在灶台的热气后面跟我唠着嗑，手里的动作没有停下。他专注地为面前的客人调制着每一碗油茶，撒上葱花，淋上红油，每一个步骤都像是执行一个默诵了千百遍的仪式。
我端着那碗油茶，坐在店门口的矮凳上。吃下一口，复杂的香气在嘴里散开，那是属于山城的，粗粝又温柔的味道。

On Chongqing's Mountain View Trail, there's a small shop specializing in traditional oil tea, run by a very passionate owner. This shop carries many Chongqing people's childhood memories and has witnessed the changes in the mountain city's alleys.

The owner has great skills, able to turn simple ingredients into bowls of heart-warming oil tea. Every sip has the taste of the mountain city, every bowl has the story of Bear Granny. He both maintains traditional methods and continuously innovates, letting every customer feel the warmth and enthusiasm of the mountain city.

His story is like the oil tea he makes - after being simmered by the years, it has become richer and fuller. This shop is not just a place to eat, but a place to convey culture and emotions. Everyone who comes here can feel that warmth from deep within the mountain city.

The owner often says that making oil tea is like being a person - you must put your heart into it and persist. Watching him focus on preparing each bowl of oil tea, I think this is the craftsman's spirit - persisting in the ordinary, innovating in inheritance.
