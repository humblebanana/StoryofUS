白象居小卖铺奶奶｜The Grandmother at Baixiangju Grocery Store

在重庆白象居，这座层层叠叠、如同迷宫般的居民楼里，每天清晨都有一个固定的场景。
一位86岁的奶奶，会从楼下开始，一步一步，向上攀登。她的步子很慢，但每一步都踩得很稳。她的目的地，是位于9楼的一家小卖铺。这段在年轻人看来都颇为费力的路程，是她日复一日的“出勤”。
她不是去上班，更不是为了赚钱。小卖铺的老板娘是她的晚辈，她去那里，更像是一种陪伴，一种习惯，一种与这个世界保持连接的方式。
奶奶是地道的重庆农村人。她的前半生，是在田野里度过的，与金黄的包谷、湿润的泥土为伴。那份从土地里生长出来的质朴与坚韧，早已刻进了她的骨子里。如今，她生活在鳞次栉比的城市高楼中，但身上依然带着那种属于田野的、沉静而有力的气息。
她的脸上总是带着笑，眼角的皱纹里，盛满了岁月的故事和对当下的满足。她喜欢和年轻人聊天，常常会认真地看着他们说：“孩子们啊，要读书。读书是唯一的出路，能让你们看到更广阔的世界。” 这句话，她或许对自己的孩子说过，对孙辈说过，如今又对每一个愿意停下来听她说话的年轻人说。话语简单，却像一颗饱满的种子，沉甸甸的。

In the alleys of Chongqing's Baixiangju, every morning you can see an 86-year-old grandmother, slowly but steadily climbing nine flights of stairs to her small grocery store. She's not doing it for money, but for the warm companionship with the shop owner, for her persistence in life.

The grandmother is a genuine Chongqing rural person who once worked in the fields alongside golden corn, cultivating hope with her own hands. That simplicity and tenacity have long been ingrained in her being. Though now living in the city, she still carries the fragrance of earth and the wisdom of accumulated years, bringing rural diligence and wisdom into urban life.

Her smile is always so kind, her eyes and brows filled with contentment for life. She often tells young people: "Children, studying is the only way out, it allows you to see a broader world." These words have no ornate language, yet contain the most simple life philosophy and deepest human wisdom.

The grandmother's life may not have earth-shattering deeds, but her day-to-day persistence and year-to-year dedication is itself a deeply moving story. Through her actions, she interprets the most beautiful connections between people and shows those shining moments of beauty in everyday life.
