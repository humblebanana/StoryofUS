重庆计程车小哥｜The Taxi Driver in Chongqing

在重庆坐出租车，本身就是一种极限运动体验。这次，我幸运地遇到了一位看起来就很“老资格”的本地小哥。
他的黄色“拓儿车”仿佛长在了山城的坡坎上，每一次上坡都动力十足，每一次转弯都行云流水，完美诠释了什么叫“只要我开得够快，导航就追不上我”。他握着方向盘，眼神扫过前方复杂的路况，就像一位经验丰富的船长在观察水文。
我们很自然地聊了起来。他说话朴实，带着重庆人特有的直爽。聊起这座城市，他像在介绍一位自己朝夕相处、脾气火爆但内心柔软的老朋友。
“重庆的房价，还算可以，”他一边说，一边在立交桥上完成了一个让导航都沉默的极限变道，“生活也舒服，所以很多外地人来了，就不想走了。” 他的语气里，有一种不加掩饰的自豪。
他每天都在这座8D城市里“飞”，见证了高楼的生长和桥梁的交错。他的车里，载过无数被立交桥绕晕的游客。“你们外地人来，是不是觉得我们这儿的路嘿复杂？”他笑着问，不等我回答就继续说，“没事，跟着我们走，丢不了！我们就是人肉GPS。”
车轮滚滚向前，窗外的江景和楼宇不断变换。我觉得，他就像这座城市的移动记录者，用车轮丈量着重庆的每一寸土地，也用眼睛和耳朵，收集着无数个关于“留下”与“离开”的故事。

This Chongqing taxi driver shuttles through the mountain city's streets and alleys every day. He speaks plainly, but his understanding of this city runs deep. "Chongqing's housing prices are still reasonable, and life is comfortable," he says while driving, "so many outsiders don't want to leave once they come here."

He has witnessed Chongqing's changes over the years and carried countless passengers from all over the country. For those outsiders who choose to settle in Chongqing, he always shows understanding and welcome. "This city has charm - the hotpot is delicious and the people are warm," he says with a smile.

Running on the roads every day, he's like a recorder of this city, measuring Chongqing's development with his wheels and witnessing every change in the city with his eyes. In his view, Chongqing is not just where he works, but the hometown he deeply loves. He uses his simple words to tell every passenger stories of this mountain city, conveying the enthusiasm and warmth of Chongqing people.
