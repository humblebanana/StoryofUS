In Chongqing's mountainside Baixiangju building, there's a small grocery store run by a kind-faced woman. She wasn't born and raised here, but married into this mountain city from a distant village, dedicating her prime youth to every inch of Chongqing.

As years passed, she took root here, supporting her small family and shop with diligent hands. Despite a simple life, her face always shows a contented and happy smile, like the first ray of morning sunshine, warm and full of strength. Her eldest son works hard in Chengdu, while her younger son grows up clever and lively by her side. Each child's progress fills her with hope for the future.

In recent years, Baixiangju has become a popular internet check-in spot due to its unique charm, attracting many tourists. She has personally witnessed its transformation from a quiet residential area to a bustling tourist attraction. Whether serving neighborhood residents or unfamiliar faces from all over, she provides service with the same enthusiasm and patience.

Her shop is not just a place to sell goods, but more like a warm station connecting people's emotions, letting travelers feel the warmth of home. Under the eaves of Baixiangju, she illuminates every passerby's heart with her light and warmth.
