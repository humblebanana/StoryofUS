白象居小卖铺老板娘｜The Grocer's Wife at Baixiangju

在重庆白象居，那座如同从山体中自然生长出来的老建筑里，时间似乎有两种流速。一种是游客带来的，快节奏的，喧嚣的；另一种，则属于一家小小的杂货铺，和它的老板娘。
老板娘是位面容和善的女人。她不是这座建筑的原住民，而是从远郊的乡村，像一粒种子，被风带到了这里。她把自己最饱满的青春，献给了这座山城的台阶与江风，最终在这里扎下了根。
她的铺子，就是她的根系所在。几十年来，她用一双勤劳的手，撑起了这个小小的空间，也撑起了一个家。生活是朴素的，甚至可以说是单调的，但她的脸上，总有一种被岁月磨砺后留下的、温润的光泽。那是一种混合了满足与希望的笑容，像江面上晨起的薄雾，柔和而有力量。当她聊起在成都打拼的大儿子，和在身边茁壮成长的小儿子时，那份光泽会变得格外明亮。
后来，外面的世界发现了白象居。游客像潮水般涌来，带来了新奇的目光、各地的口音和闪烁的镜头。老板娘亲眼见证了这一切。她看着自己熟悉的、安静的家园，变成了别人口中的“网红打-卡地”。
但潮水没有改变她。她的铺子，依然是那个铺子。无论是几十年的老邻居，还是第一次踏足此地的陌生游客，她都报以同样的耐心与热情。她不会因为人潮而慌乱，也不会因为喧嚣而烦躁。她就像白象居这座建筑本身，沉默地承载着所有的新与旧，动与静。

In Chongqing's mountainside Baixiangju building, there's a small grocery store run by a kind-faced woman. She wasn't born and raised here, but married into this mountain city from a distant village, dedicating her prime youth to every inch of Chongqing.

As years passed, she took root here, supporting her small family and shop with diligent hands. Despite a simple life, her face always shows a contented and happy smile, like the first ray of morning sunshine, warm and full of strength. Her eldest son works hard in Chengdu, while her younger son grows up clever and lively by her side. Each child's progress fills her with hope for the future.

In recent years, Baixiangju has become a popular internet check-in spot due to its unique charm, attracting many tourists. She has personally witnessed its transformation from a quiet residential area to a bustling tourist attraction. Whether serving neighborhood residents or unfamiliar faces from all over, she provides service with the same enthusiasm and patience.

Her shop is not just a place to sell goods, but more like a warm station connecting people's emotions, letting travelers feel the warmth of home. Under the eaves of Baixiangju, she illuminates every passerby's heart with her light and warmth.
