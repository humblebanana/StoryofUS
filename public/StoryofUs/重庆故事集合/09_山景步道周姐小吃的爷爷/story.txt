山景步道周姐小吃的爷爷｜The Elderly Gentleman at Zhou Sister's Snack

在重庆的山景步道上，有一家名为"周姐小吃店"的铺子。在这里，你能同时遇到周姐，和她的老伴——一位七十六岁的爷爷。
爷爷是主厨，是这家店的灵魂。他是地道的山城人，岁月在他脸上刻下了沟壑，也把一生的手艺沉淀在了他那双饱经风霜的手里。那双手，在灶台前依旧灵巧、稳健，做出来的小吃，是那种最朴素、最不花哨的家乡味道。
而周姐，则像这家店温暖的底色。她话不多，总是带着温和的笑意，在店里忙前忙后。当我点了一碗面，她会端到我面前，然后拿起筷子，用一种极其自然熟练的动作，亲手为我把面拌匀，再把筷子递给我，轻声说一句："吃嘛。" 那一刻，我感觉自己不像个食客，更像一个回到家、等着长辈开饭的孩子，心里瞬间就暖了。
爷爷则是个健谈的人。在烹饪的间隙，他喜欢靠在门边，和来往的客人闲聊。他的话题很广，能从最新的国家大事，聊到年轻人的教育问题。

On the mountain scenic trail in Chongqing, there's a small establishment called "Zhou Sister's Snack Shop." Here, you can meet both Zhou Sister and her companion—a seventy-six-year-old grandfather.
Grandfather is the head chef, the soul of this shop. He's an authentic mountain city native; time has carved furrows on his face while depositing a lifetime of culinary skills in his weather-beaten hands. Those hands remain dexterous and steady at the stove, creating snacks with the most unpretentious, straightforward hometown flavors.
Zhou Sister is like the warm undertone of this shop. She doesn't talk much, always carrying a gentle smile as she bustles about. When I order a bowl of noodles, she brings it to me, then picks up the chopsticks and, with an incredibly natural and practiced motion, personally mixes the noodles for me before handing me the chopsticks, softly saying, "Eat now." In that moment, I don't feel like a customer, but more like a child who has returned home and is waiting for elders to serve dinner—my heart instantly warms.
Grandfather is quite talkative. During breaks from cooking, he likes to lean by the doorway, chatting casually with passing customers. His topics are wide-ranging, from the latest national affairs to issues concerning young people's education.
