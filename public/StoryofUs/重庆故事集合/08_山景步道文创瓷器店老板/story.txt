山景步道文创瓷器店老板｜Cultural Creative Porcelain Shop Owner

在重庆，顺着一条山景步道往深处走，远离了城市的喧嚣后，会遇见一间瓷器店。
店开得很安静，像是从山石和绿植中自然生长出来的一样。店主是位艺术家，你能在他的作品和言谈中，感受到他对重庆这座城市沉重的情感。
他的双手，似乎有一种能与泥土对话的魔力。那些冰冷的瓷土，在他手中经过揉捏、塑形、上釉、烧制，最终被赋予了生命和温度。他创作的主题，都来自他对这座城市的观察：一件作品上，可能描绘着穿楼而过的轻轨；另一件上，则勾勒着长江索道的剪影；还有的，干脆就是巷子里喝茶、打牌的市井百态。
每一件瓷器，都像是一个时间的切片，一个记忆的容器。它们将重庆那些正在消失的，或是依旧鲜活的场景，用一种永恒的方式凝固了下来。它们是桥梁，一头连着山城模糊的过去，一头连着你我所站立的现在。
你拿起一只茶杯，杯壁上画着几根错落的棒棒。那一刻，你仿佛能听到嘉陵江边的号子声。你端详一个花瓶，瓶身上是南山起伏的轮廓。那一刻，你似乎能闻到空气里桂花与泥土的混合气息。
店主不常主动推销，他更像一个守护者，安静地坐在角落，打磨着新的作品。他相信，每一件瓷器都会自己说话，会找到能读懂它的那个人。

In Chongqing, following a mountain trail deeper into the path, away from the city's clamor, you'll encounter a porcelain shop.
The shop sits quietly, as if it naturally grew from the mountain rocks and greenery. The owner is an artist, and through his works and conversations, you can feel his profound affection for the city of Chongqing.
His hands seem to possess a magical ability to converse with clay. The cold ceramic clay, after being kneaded, shaped, glazed, and fired in his hands, is ultimately bestowed with life and warmth. The themes of his creations all stem from his observations of the city: one piece might depict a light rail passing through buildings; another sketches the silhouette of the Yangtze River cableway; and some simply capture the everyday scenes of people drinking tea and playing cards in the alleyways.
Each piece of porcelain is like a slice of time, a vessel of memory. They preserve those scenes of Chongqing that are either fading away or still vibrant, freezing them in an eternal manner. They are bridges, connecting the mountain city's hazy past at one end and the present where you and I stand at the other.
You pick up a teacup, its walls painted with a few scattered "bangbang" poles. In that moment, you can almost hear the chants of porters by the Jialing River. You examine a vase, its body depicting the undulating contours of Nanshan. In that moment, you seem to smell the mixed fragrance of osmanthus and soil in the air.
The shop owner rarely actively promotes his wares; he is more like a guardian, sitting quietly in the corner, polishing new pieces. He believes that each porcelain item speaks for itself and will find the person who can understand it.
