鹅岭二厂后院老板｜The Courtyard Owner of Eling Second Factory

在重庆鹅岭的二厂后院，有一家特别的咖啡厅，老板是位室内设计师兼艺术家。他用自己独特的美学眼光，把这个老工业遗址改造成了充满艺术气息的温暖空间。

他不只是个设计师，更像是个哲学家。聊天时，他会跟你谈论历史、城市规划、音乐，还有人生的道理。"万物都在变化，唯一不变的就是变化本身，"他说话时眼神深邃，像是在分享人生的感悟。

他鼓励每个来这里的人要有梦想，要相信自己。"就像吸引力法则一样，你心里想什么，就会吸引什么，"他温和地说。当心情来了，他会拿起吉他弹唱，《Tears in Heaven》和《贝加尔湖畔》都是他的拿手曲目，那种深情的演绎让人动容。

在这个充满创意的空间里，他不只是在经营一家咖啡厅，更是在传递一种生活的态度——用心感受生活，用艺术温暖人心。

In the courtyard of Eling Second Factory in Chongqing, there's a special coffee shop owned by an interior designer and artist. He used his unique aesthetic vision to transform this old industrial site into a warm space full of artistic atmosphere.

He's not just a designer, but more like a philosopher. When chatting, he'll discuss history, urban planning, music, and life principles with you. "All things are changing, the only constant is change itself," he says with deep eyes, as if sharing life insights.

He encourages everyone who comes here to have dreams and believe in themselves. "Just like the Law of Attraction, what you think in your heart will attract what comes to you," he says gently. When the mood strikes, he'll pick up his guitar and sing, with "Tears in Heaven" and "Baikal Side" being his signature pieces, his soulful performances moving people's hearts.

In this creative space, he's not just running a coffee shop, but conveying an attitude toward life - feeling life with your heart and warming hearts with art.
